Deleting the .git folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

Checkout/create orphan branch (this branch won't show in git branch command):

    git checkout --orphan latest_branch

Add all the files to the newly created branch:

    git add -A

Commit the changes:

    git commit -am "commit message"

Delete main (default) branch (this step is permanent):

    git branch -D main

Rename the current branch to main:

    git branch -m main

Finally, all changes are completed on your local repository, and force update your remote repository:

    git push -f origin main

PS: This will not keep your old commit history around. Now you should only see your new commit in the history of your git repository.

    git gc --aggressive --prune=all     # remove the old files
    git push -f origin main

Here are the steps to clear out the history of a Github repository

First, remove the history from .git

rm -rf .git

Now, recreate the git repos from the current content only

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Push to the Github remote repos ensuring you overwrite history


git remote add origin git@github.com:ABoehlen/pdc2pdf.git
git push -u --force origin main
